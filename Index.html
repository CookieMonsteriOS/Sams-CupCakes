		<p class="sectionTitle">Reasons to try these:</h2>
		<ul class="factsList">
			<li>Avocados are one of the only fruits that contain heart-healthy monounsaturated fat (the good-for-you fat) that helps boost good (HDL) cholesterol and lowers bad (LDL) cholesterol.</li>
			<br>
			<li>An avocado serving size is 50 calories, which works out to be 3 thin slices or 2 tablespoons mashed. There are fewer calories than the same amount of butter, mayonnaise, sour cream, peanut butter, almond butter, olive oil, and coconut oil â€” PLUS avocado has over 20 vitamins and minerals to upgrade your natural diet! Use avocado as a substitute today!.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Avocados are naturally FULL of nutrition, so there's no need for special labels. They're full of flavor; think of all of the meals you can healthify with avocado!
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			Their thick skin protects them; it's natural packaging! You can't eat the skin, but it shields the green goodness inside, making avocados perfect for travel.

			<p>So if you are wondering who came up with this crazy idea? Well this company was the brian child of a young man who used to write code by day and bake by night - so here it is: Sam's Cup Cakes. 	</p>
